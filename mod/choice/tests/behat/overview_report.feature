    And I click on "Get these logs" "button"
    Then I should see "Course activities overview page viewed"
    And I should see "viewed the instance list for the module 'choice'"

  @javascript
  Scenario: Students can see relevant columns in the choice overview
    Given I am on the "Course 1" "course > activities > choice" page logged in as "student1"
    # Check columns.
    Then I should see "Name" in the "choice_overview_collapsible" "region"
    And I should see "Allow responses until" in the "choice_overview_collapsible" "region"
    And I should see "Completion status" in the "choice_overview_collapsible" "region"
    And I should see "Responded" in the "choice_overview_collapsible" "region"
    # Check Responded.
    And I should see "Answered" in the "Choice 1" "table_row"
    And I should see "Not answered yet" in the "Choice 2" "table_row"
    # Cheack allow responses until.
    And I should see "1 January 2040" in the "Choice 1" "table_row"

    # Check Response count.
    And I should see "3" in the "Choice 1" "table_row"
